We have hats!

Actually we have anything you can think of with our logo on it. I had our
logo embroidery digitized (whatever that means) and it can be embroidered
on just about anything. Just head down to Bowlers Depot (37th and El Cajon)
and mention San Diego Python. You can show your love of Python to the world
and represent San Diego at the same time. You can bring your own bag, hat,
hoodie or polo or you can order something there with the logo on it. The
embroidery itself is about $8 so a nice flexfit Port Authority cap like
this costs a little under $20 all told. My head apparently is huge
so I got the L/XL. I think it looks better on white than black. Feel free
to change up the colors too. I think it would look good in pink!

San Diego Python does not make any money from this. It just gets our name
out and spreads the Python love. If you want to do something else with our
logo, high quality versions are on
