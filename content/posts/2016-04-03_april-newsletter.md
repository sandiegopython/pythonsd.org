Jobs

[Python Engineer][eastridge-job] (eastridge.com) <br />
"Our industry employs millions of people around the world. But
the software that powers it has a notorious reputation. Too frequently,
enterprise software is poorly designed, not extensible, and difficult
to maintain. At Eastridge, our vision is to defy those expectations. We
built our industry's first RESTful cloud platform. Our platform enables
us to develop applications in a fraction of the time, while making it
easy to integrate 3rd parties."
