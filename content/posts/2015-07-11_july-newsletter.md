[Saturday study group][saturday-meetup] (meetup.com) <br />
San Diego PyLadies and SD Python are continuing the Saturday study group
at the Ansir Innovation Center. The goal of the Saturday study group is to
learn Python together in a collaborative environment. The study group is open
to people of all skill levels and is particularly open to those new to Python.

[Introduction to Interactive Programming with Python][rice-course] (coursera) <br />
This excellent and fun course has just started again. Join Diane, Maggie, Rebecca, Alain, Eric, Gopal, Jaime, Juan, Kyle, Peter and many others at each Saturday Study Group (see above) as we take, or retake, this class. Sure, we'll improve our collection of python made video-games! Also we'll master the skills of interactive programming with python to the point of teaching others. You could be the next tutor in a Coding Class for teenagers at UCSD!
